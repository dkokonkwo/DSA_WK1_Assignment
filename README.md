1. Frequency Count of Array Elements (2)

Assessment Goals:

Implement an algorithm to count the frequency of each element in an array.
Determine the time complexity of the algorithm
Tasks:

Create an array and write a function that counts the frequency of each element.
Implement this using the algorithm of your choice.
Analyze the time complexity of the algorithm in place.

2. Sorting Algorithm Implementations (4)

Assessment Goals:

Implement selection and merge sort programs using arrays.
Analyze the algorithms in place and determine the running time complexities.
Tasks:

Given a file (.txt) that contains full names, line by line you. The program will open the file and sort the names in ascending order.
Use Selection Sort, and Merge Sort to sort the names.
The sorted names should replace the already non-ordered names in the file. Remember that names will remain in their proper position regardless of case sensitivity.
The user can choose to add a new name to the file, in that case the name should be added to the right position (properly sorted).
Analyze the algorithms used and determine the time complexity of each algorithm.
Compare their time complexities in best, average and worst case
Visualize the results in a graph to understand the difference (consider 5 < n < 200)

Based on the analysis of algorithms, determine the best algorithm to use while c

3. Contact Management System (5)

Assessment Goals: 

Create contacts
Manage contacts
Tasks:

Implement a singly linked list where each node represents a contact with details like name, and phone number.
Populate all registered contacts in ascending order
Add a new contact (every time a new contact is added, the entire list should be sorted in order to have that contact in its right position)
The program will equally delete, and update the contacts after which operation the list will be observed in its right order.
The program will be used to search a contact
Analyze the algorithms and present their time complexity. Discuss the best, average, and worst case of each operation (algorithm).
